# Sponsoring DevOps DC

Our sponsorships usually require a commitment to host the meeting or provide food and beverages for the meeting.  Food and beverage cost is usually in the $200-$300 range for each meeting.  Sponsors will be thanked by the MC for the evening or may opt to have a 5 minute presentation to the members of the meeting.

Please [contact the organizers via meetup](http://www.meetup.com/messages/?new_convo=true) or email Nathen <nathen.harvey@gmail.com> if you are interested in sponsoring an upcoming DevOpsDC Meetup.
