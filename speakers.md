### A model-driven approach to DevOps

Vishwas Lele - CTO, Applied Information Sciences and Microsoft Regional Director

This talks demonstrates a model-driven approach to DevOps in which a common DSL unifies different parts of a software organization. This talks covers many areas of DevOps, because DevOps is not just "Development and Operations". It applies to the whole organization.

This includes:

* App architecture
* Release management
* ITSM
* Service catalog 
* Performance engineering
* QA
* Monitoring
* Security
* High Availability

Using this approach, teams speaks a common language and contribute parts of the overall shared DevOps model. This minimizes "impedance mismatch" and increases situational awareness. Additionally model-driven DevOps can help avoid script automation sprawl.

Demos are of a specific implementation of model driven DevOps - Azure Resource Manager.
